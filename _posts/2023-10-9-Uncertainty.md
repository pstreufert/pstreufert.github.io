Longley et al. suggests that as spatial analysis moves from the real world data to  representation and measurements, uncertainty within our analysis is inevitable. This stands true of my experience in geographic research. This summer I conceived and conducted a prescribed burning experiment in the sierra oak woodlands that used UAV technology to explore and estimate greenhouse gas emissions from burns on a single ranch property. This study was done in an exploratory setting to advise larger burns and future research with the UAV. When crafting the research methods, we selected scope of study, tools for measurements, and burn that we hoped would bring our estimates as close to the real world data as possible. Naturally we ran into many unexpected variables that altered the confidence in our data. 

As geographers it is our responsibility to outline where uncertainty in studies may stem from rather than covering them up to project significance. It also may be helpful for geographers publishing studies to suggest how further research may fix some of these uncertainties, to promote a collaborative research culture. To aid in the process of creating an open research culture where uncertainty is accepted, sharing code, data, and methods will help fellow researchers recognize and quantify uncertainties in studies.
