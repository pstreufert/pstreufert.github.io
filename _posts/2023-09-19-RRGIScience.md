The concept of open source or free software entered the mainstream in the early 1990’s; terms referring to software where the source code is available for users to view, modify, and redistribute to the public. The openness of the code intentionally encourages collaboration, transparency in methods, and dialogue between users. The ambiguity of the term “free” in free software led the movement’s leaders to coin the term open source to differentiate it from freeware/shareware: software that might be distributed freely, but source code is proprietary. 

Practice of open source GIS actively encourages reproducibility and replicability in the field, meaning that not only should the software used be open source, but the ways you use it should be transparent and understandable. Currently the field of geography faces challenges with both **reproducibility** and **replicability**. To many these terms are analogous but represent distinct aspects of the open source journey.

| Reproducibility | Are the data and analysis laid out with sufficient transparency and clarity that the results can be checked?
| Reproducibility| If checked, do the data and analysis offered in support of the result in fact support that result?|
|Replicability| If the data and analysis are shown to support the original result, can the result reported be found again in the specific study context investigated?|
|Replicability & Generalizability| Can the result reported or the inference drawn be found again in a broader set of study contexts?|

The field of Geography and the wider umbrella of academia have a problem with  reproducibility and replicability. Today, academics' worth are often evaluated based on the quantity and impact of published output, a metric heavily influenced by large publishing groups.  The emphasis on quantity and impact has created an environment that at times inadvertently encourages questionable research practices. In some instances, research papers have incomplete, convoluted, or opaque methodologies that hinder fellow researchers' ability to reproduce or replicate their study. Authors may selectively report only a portion of their results to amplify significance or manipulate data analysis intentionally to skew outcomes.

If open source reproducibility and replicability become common practice in the field, there will be greater transparency among researchers. This may foster a research environment with a greater appreciation for collaboration, method and best practice refinement, and dissemination of unsuccessful experiments, rather than one that chases statistically significant results, impact factors, and quantity published papers.
