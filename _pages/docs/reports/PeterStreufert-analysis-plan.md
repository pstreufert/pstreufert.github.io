Social inequities in the distribution of COVID-19: An intra-categorical
analysis of people with disabilities in the U.S.

## Analysis

The current study to explore effects of the covid 19 pandemic on peoples with disablities (PwD) draws from a collection of hotspots using a Kulldorff spatial scan statistic. This tool selects hotspots by aggragating data at a county level to calculate realtative risk at within various spherical great circle distance calculations; upon calculating these score, the model selects the circle with the greatest realative risk and designates the epicenter of the cluster and the surrounding counties. The model problematically clumps the majority of the southeast into a single hotspot, ignoring key covid centers; maimi, altanta, orlando, ect... By lowering the circle population threshold from 50% to 5%, key hotspots located in the periphery of larger hotspots will be included in the bivarite regession model to identify the effects on covid-19 on disadvantaged communities. 

## Results

Changes in counties selected as covid-19 hotspots will be shown in a side-by-side map comparsion with Chaborty's orginial covid hotpspot map. Another map will highlight the counties where the two maps differ. 

The new counties and their respective relative risks will be entered into the multivariate regression model to assess if the hidden hotspots in the american southeast highlight signficant disparaties in Pwd. This table will be displayed alongside the original regression table from Chakraborty, 2020. 

## Discussion

If the new map shows multiple covid 19 hotspots in the american southeast, this will suggest that the threshold set in the GEE tool to estimate realative risk was too expansive, resulting in key missed hotspots. If the multivariate regression table shows signifcant change in the r-values for covid incident rates in PwD this will confirm the significance of the re-evaluation.
